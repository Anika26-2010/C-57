    <h3>HOCKEY
            </h3>
            <h4>Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Beginning in Nova Scotia in the early 1800s, hockey began to evolve into the team sport we know today. Today, Canada remains the country most closely-associated with hockey. The development of the modern version of organized ice hockey played as a team sport is often credited to James Creighton.Hockey at its core is a very simple game. You skate, you pass, you shoot and you score. Before jumping onto the ice, it's worth getting to know a few basics of the game.A player cannot use the hands, stick or extension of the arms to body check an opponent or deliver an avoidable body check to a player who is not in possession and control of the puck . Examples include: Intentionally playing the body of an opponent who does not have possession and control of the puck.National Hockey League games are contested over three 20-minute periods. If the score is tied after 60 minutes, the game moves to a five-minute, sudden-death overtime where the first goal wins. If the game remains tied after overtime, a shootout is held until a winner is determined.
